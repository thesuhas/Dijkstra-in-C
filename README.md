# Dijkstra-in-C
 
Dijkstra is used to solve a <b>Single-Destination Shortest Path<b> problem to get the shortest path from all vertices in a graph to a given vertex.


## Input Format

The first line of the input file contains the number of vertices in the graph. <br>
The subsequent lines consist of: Node {vertex, weight of connection to vertex} where the pair of {vertex, weight} can be repeated for every other vertex in the graph. <br>
The last vertex (the highest numbered vertex) is taken as the Destination.
